# Fernando Luz's CV

## CV formats

My CV is available in the following formats and layouts:

### Current views

- [DevResume](https://fluz.github.io/cv/index.html) (HTML)
- [CeevVee](https://fluz.github.io/cv/cv_ceevee.html) (HTML)
- [markdown](https://fluz.github.io/cv/cv_fernando_luz.md) (markdown) and two rendered versions:

  - [html](https://fluz.github.io/cv/cv_fernando_luz_md.html)
- [europassCV](https://fluz.github.io/europasscv/cv.pdf)

## Behind the scenes

I keep my *Curriculum Vitae* using software development techniques, namely:

- Maintain the source code in [github](https://github.com/fluz/cv).
- Create different views for the same base [fluz.yml](https://github.com/fluz/cv/fluz.yml)
- Use automated deploy with Github Actions.

## To do

- Code validation ?

## Structure

The structure of the data is as follows:

- fluz.yml: single data source in [YAML](http://yaml.org/).
