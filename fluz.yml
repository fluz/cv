  **12+ years** of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving **complex problems** in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven **self-starter** and **fast learner**, always supporting my development teams with **top-notch coding skills**. In my last project **I lead** a pilot project to migrate around **400 test cases** with a constraints of **10 weeks** with **100% achievement**.

  12+ years of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven self-starter and fast learner, always supporting my development teams with top-notch coding skills. In my last project I lead a pilot project to migrate around 400 test cases with a constraints of 10 weeks with 100% achievement.

aboutme_bkp: |
  I am a developer with a Ph.D. in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and with over 10 years of experience in **C++/C** developing numerical models and simulators.

  All these years that I have been working in development led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and software such as C++/C in numerical simulations, MongoDB to use for persistent memory for applications, Python to integrate different software, C# and Unity 3D to provide a immersive simulation environment, CMake/CDash to provide a cross-compile environment and test the code at the repository and Bash tools to automate the tasks in the Linux.

  As a team leader, what most motivated me was the challenge to maintain team cooperation to reach objectives in the process development. I have the experience to implement a Scrum/Kanban methodology, to share my knowledge with my colleagues and I believe programming requires writing skills so I do my best to write clear and good code and follow best practices.

  I was one of the founders in the Meetup group in Altran PT, and currently I am coordinator of Meetup sessions.


aboutme_old: |
    I'm currently working as an embedded software architect of DmOS - DATACOM's
    universal embedded OS. I focus on modularity, continuous integration,
    incremental qualification and DevOps. I work very closely with the DevOps
    team, bringing solutions and new technologies, and also helping in general.

    I was one of the architects that worked on the initial definitions of the
    architecture, processes and tools used nowadays in the company. The
    architecture group itself was something new back then.

    Before the creation of the architecture group, I led small (8) development
    teams. At first, I led teams of embedded software development for about 5
    years, as I started as a developer myself. I then led the test
    infrastructure team for about a year while also acting as a software
    architect for the Ethernet switch product line.

    I hold a master degree in computer science from UFRGS. My research line was
    on computer networks, distributed systems, fault tolerance and security. My
    dissertation was about distributed firewall rule coherence. I implemented
    the prototype checker in Haskell.

    I hold an MBA on management and leadership from UNISINOS. I graduated in
    electrical engineering from UFRGS.

    I value technical excellence, out-of-the-box thinking, generalism, strategic
    planning and long-term maintainability. I'm always looking for
    vulnerabilities and enhancement opportunities in my knowledge and tool set.

    Out of the professional context, I have studied and obtained a license to fly
    sailplanes. I can definitely say that I learned a lot from doing that, from the
    differences with my area (extreme risk aversion) as well as from the
    similarities (briefing/debriefing ~ sprint planning/review).

professional:
  - company: Altran
    position: Senior Software Engineer
    period: 2020 - Present
    description: |
      I was responsible to start the ASML project, where firstly I collaborated to apply the Variant Patterning in the robot component for the next generation of lithography machines(EXE-5000), and currently I'm leading the Portugal team to improve the quality of unit tests using gtest.

      Achievements / Tasks:
    achievements:
      - item: Complete implementation for RYUN (Universal Pick and Place Robot) component;
      - item: Unit tests for RYUN (ATTEST/gtest) providing a 100% of coverage;
      - item: Migration of RYAU component to RYAULE (legacy version);
      - item: Scope analysis of RYAU autotesters, where I found a 65% of fake tests (tests without implementation);
      - item: Delivery with success the first phase for UTTK to ATTEST migration (~400 tests in 10 weeks);

  - company: Technomar Eng.
    position: IT Manager
    period: 2016 - 2018

      I managed the team responsible for developing a new version of vessel maneuver
      simulator for maritime offshore operations and ports to be used in training activities.
      The objective was to obtain a certified simulator by DNV agency with an advanced
      hydrodynamic numerical model applied in a "full bridge" simulator.
      I implemented good practices in the software development process such as
      Scrum/Kanban methodology, TDD, some git good practices and local meetups to
      homogenize the team knowledge.
      I planned a full redesign of the main simulator, aims to improve the performance,
      readability and the maintenance. This refactoring was necessary to start a
      certification process with DNV. I adopt the Gitlab philosophy to define metrics for
      all projects, and stimulate all team members to use these tools, I manage the
      sprints, daily meetups and backlogs to all projects. At last, I create a communication
      channel between the end user and the development team to provide a fast feedback
      to customer needs.

  - company: Numerical Offshore Tank
    position: Researcher / HPC Soft. Eng.
    period: 2008 - 2016

      My role in this laboratory was to develop a set of applications with High-Performance

      and bash in a Linux Cluster environment. Other responsibilities include testing
      and validation of numerical simulations, optimization, improvements of parallel
      implementations and integration with other projects.
      I worked in several others projects including the first version of vessel maneuver
      simulator called SMH. This project was select as finalist of ANP (National Petroleum
      Agency) Prize Award for Technological Innovation in 2016.

random:
  - I installed my first Debian GNU/Linux at home in 2003, and never reinstalled it
    from scratch. I use the "testing" release, and update it constantly.
  - I learned Haskell while developing the prototype of my MSc dissertation in 2006.
    Since then, I have used it on side projects and on programming contests when I
    have the chance.
  - Even though I did not take computer science at graduation, I was 6th on the
    entry exam of the MSc at my University (UFRGS).
  - I once got all questions right in a logical reasoning test. The psychologist
    that evaluated it said that she had never seen that before.
  - This CV is maintained at <http://github.com/lpenz/cv> with configuration
    management, automated tests and continuous deployment
    to <http://cv.lpenz.org> in several output formats.
