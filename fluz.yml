aboutme: |
  **15+ years** of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving **complex problems** in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions, and research labs. Driven **self-starter** and **fast learner**, always supporting my development teams with **top-notch coding skills**.
  I enjoy the challenge to maintain **team cooperation** to achieve objectives/deliveries in the process development. I strongly believe that **sharing knowledge** is a key point in a dev team, and I do my best to write clear and good code and implement best practices.

  15+ years of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven self-starter and fast learner, always supporting my development teams with top-notch coding skills. In my last project I lead a pilot project to migrate around 400 test cases with a constraints of 10 weeks with 100% achievement.

aboutme_bkp: |
  I am a developer with a Ph.D. in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and with over 10 years of experience in **C++/C** developing numerical models and simulators.

  All these years that I have been working in development led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and software such as C++/C in numerical simulations, MongoDB to use for persistent memory for applications, Python to integrate different software, C# and Unity 3D to provide a immersive simulation environment, CMake/CDash to provide a cross-compile environment and test the code at the repository and Bash tools to automate the tasks in the Linux.

  As a team leader, what most motivated me was the challenge to maintain team cooperation to reach objectives in the process development. I have the experience to implement a Scrum/Kanban methodology, to share my knowledge with my colleagues and I believe programming requires writing skills so I do my best to write clear and good code and follow best practices.

  I was one of the founders in the Meetup group in Altran PT, and currently I am coordinator of Meetup sessions.
