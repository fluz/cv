  **12+ years** of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving **complex problems** in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven **self-starter** and **fast learner**, always supporting my development teams with **top-notch coding skills**. In my last project, **I led** a pilot project to migrate around **400 test cases** with a constraints of **10 weeks** with **100% accomplished**.

  12+ years of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven self-starter and fast learner, always supporting my development teams with top-notch coding skills. In my last project I lead a pilot project to migrate around 400 test cases with a constraints of 10 weeks with 100% achievement.

aboutme_bkp: |
  I am a developer with a Ph.D. in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and with over 10 years of experience in **C++/C** developing numerical models and simulators.

  All these years that I have been working in development led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and software such as C++/C in numerical simulations, MongoDB to use for persistent memory for applications, Python to integrate different software, C# and Unity 3D to provide a immersive simulation environment, CMake/CDash to provide a cross-compile environment and test the code at the repository and Bash tools to automate the tasks in the Linux.

  As a team leader, what most motivated me was the challenge to maintain team cooperation to reach objectives in the process development. I have the experience to implement a Scrum/Kanban methodology, to share my knowledge with my colleagues and I believe programming requires writing skills so I do my best to write clear and good code and follow best practices.

  I was one of the founders in the Meetup group in Altran PT, and currently I am coordinator of Meetup sessions.

aboutme_old: |
    I'm currently working as an embedded software architect of DmOS - DATACOM's universal embedded OS. I focus on modularity, continuous integration, incremental qualification and DevOps. I work very closely with the DevOps team, bringing solutions and new technologies, and also helping in general.

    I was one of the architects that worked on the initial definitions of the architecture, processes and tools used nowadays in the company. The architecture group itself was something new back then.

    Before the creation of the architecture group, I led small (8) development teams. At first, I led teams of embedded software development for about 5 years, as I started as a developer myself. I then led the test infrastructure team for about a year while also acting as a software architect for the Ethernet switch product line.

    I hold a master degree in computer science from UFRGS. My research line was on computer networks, distributed systems, fault tolerance and security. My dissertation was about distributed firewall rule coherence. I implemented the prototype checker in Haskell.

    I hold an MBA on management and leadership from UNISINOS. I graduated in electrical engineering from UFRGS.

    I value technical excellence, out-of-the-box thinking, generalism, strategic planning and long-term maintainability. I'm always looking for vulnerabilities and enhancement opportunities in my knowledge and tool set.

    Out of the professional context, I have studied and obtained a license to fly sailplanes. I can definitely say that I learned a lot from doing that, from the differences with my area (extreme risk aversion) as well as from the similarities (briefing/debriefing ~ sprint planning/review).
