## About me

With over **16+ years** of experience in software development, I've evolved from a proficient Software Engineer into an accomplished **Engineering Manager**. My journey has encompassed a wide array of projects and industries, from startups to oil and gas companies, educational institutions, and research labs.

As a **self-driven**, **quick learner**, and **top-notch coder**, I firmly believe in the importance of **knowledge sharing** and consistently promote **clear**, **high-quality coding**, and **best practices**. My transition to the Engineering Manager role reflects my passion for **talent development**, driving **impactful projects**, and contributing to **organizational success** at the intersection of technology and engineering.

## Experience

### *Engineering Manager* --- Talkdesk, 2022 - Present

I've overseen a broad portfolio, including products like **Healthcare Experience Cloud**, **Automated Notifications**, and **Agent Flows**, along with the **QA team**. I've had the privilege of leading and mentoring a team of **10+ Individual Contributors**, ranging from entry-level professionals to team leads.

**Achievements / Tasks:**

* The **Healthcare Experience Cloud** has been a cornerstone of our efforts, involving the seamless integration of healthcare call centers with more efficient and informed patient interactions;
* The **Automated Notifications** has been instrumental in enhancing communication, focusing on the definition of rules and events to schedule and deliver notifications, ensuring timely and precise interactions with the customers;
* The **Agent Flows** improved support processes by empowering agents with scripted guidance during customer calls;
* The **QA team** has established a robust E2E tests framework to rigorously validate product quality, ensuring that our solutions work properly in the Talkdesk environment.

### *Senior Software Engineer* --- Talkdesk, 2021 - 2022

Integrated a new team from the ground up to create a new solution for banking financial services.

The tech stack in this project uses **Kotlin**, **SpringBoot**, **React**, **Redis**, **PostGres SQL**, **MongoDB**, and **RabbitMQ**.

**Achievements / Tasks:**

* Released the first version of Visual IVR for Financial Services in the Summer release;
* Created an in-house solution for Visual IVR Frontend;
* Presented technical sessions to introduce new technologies (Functional Programming, K6).

### *Senior Software Engineer* --- Capgemini Portugal [ASML Project], 2018 - 2021

Started the **ASML** project, where I contributed to the new lithography machine generation project. I led the Portugal team to expand unit test implementation with a framework based on **gtest** and implemented the **Variant Pattern** in a robot component.
I also was one of the founders of the Meetup internal group in Altran PT.

**Achievements / Tasks:**

* Delivered the first version of the RYUN (Universal Pick and Place Robot) component, with **all features planned** and **100% of code coverage**;
* Contributed with the RYAU component **migration** to the legacy version and investigated for RYAU autotesters, where I found **65% fake tests** (tests without implementation);
* Achieved with success the first phase for UTTK to ATTEST migration **(around 400 tests in 10 weeks instead of the initial estimation of 24 weeks)**.

### *IT Manager* --- Technomar Engineering, 2016 - 2018

I led a team in charge of implementing new features for the **Technomar Maritime Simulator** used in training activities. I initiated the certification plan with [DNV GL agency](https://www.dnvgl.com/) and contributed to the core of the hydrodynamic numerical model. Additionally, I fostered best practices in software development, including the use of **Scrum**, **Test-Driven Development**, **Git**, and conducted mentoring sessions to enhance team knowledge.

**Achievements / Tasks:**

* Enhanced communication channel using the phonon framework, with gains in **15% speedup** and improved the code maintainability;
* Orchestrated the **full delivery** of a new simulation station at the Technomar office, providing a simulator with 360 degrees immersion;
* Instituted **Gitlab** as a tool to obtain code metrics, and manage the bugs, new features, backlog, and milestone control for the team and the founders.

### *Researcher / HPC Software Engineer* --- Numerical Offshore Tank, 2008 - 2016

In the TPN laboratory, I developed **High-Performance Computing** applications using **C++/C**, **Python**, **MPI/sockets**, and **bash** in Linux and Windows. I also handled testing, optimization, parallel improvements, and integration with other projects. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of **SMH**, a finalist for the [2016 ANP Prize Award for Technological Innovation](http://www.anp.gov.br/pesquisa-desenvolvimento-inovacao/302-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica/edicoes-anteriores/888-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica-2016).

**Achievements / Tasks:**

* Optimized parallel execution of the numerical solver in the cluster environment saving around **35% in resources** using my Ph.D. research;
* Achieved improvements in the Numerical Solver, reducing execution time by **10%** through the utilization of **OpenMP**, and implemented **MPI standards** in the Parallel version;
* Championed the use of *development tests* flow to increase the development quality and built an initial **CI** with (CDash and CTest) to check the repository integrity.
